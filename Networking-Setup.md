# Network Set-up
To ensure that I did not have any potential legal or network issues, I chose to setup the two virual boxes of Kali and Metasploitable to Host-only instead of NAT. 
## Why Host-Only
By using host-only, I would ensure that the VMs are isolated from the internet and my local network, with the only communication being the host system(my laptop) and other VMs
configured in the same network. This would be Kali and Metasploitable
